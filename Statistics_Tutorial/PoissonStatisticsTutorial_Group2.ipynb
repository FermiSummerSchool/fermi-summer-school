    "The likelihood gives us an estimate for the probability of having recorded our observing data given some underlying \"true\" model and model parameters. However, we don't know what these true parameters are; that's exactly what we're trying to estimate! We can do so by stepping through different parameter values, and recording the likelihood of having observed the data, given the assumption that these parameters are true. We then pick the parameters that give us the highest likelihood value as the \"best\" parameters given our observed data. This is called **maximum likelihood estimation**. \n",

    "It is a somewhat subtle, but important distinction that the likelihood is *not* a probability distribution of the parameters, but of the data. It assumes that we are drawing random realizations from an underlying model, given a model and parameters that are known to be true. While you can make meaningful statistical inferences about a scientific problem this way, there are some cases where the structure of the likelihood as a probability of the data makes your life a bit harder. Later, we will talk about how Bayes' theorem gives you a convenient way to flip the probabilities around, and get a probability distribution of the parameters given an observed data set. \n",

    "So how do we search for the maximum likelihood in practice? One thing you can do is make a grid of parameters, calculate the likelihood for each one, and then simply pick the largest one. This can work great, but also has some significant drawbacks: for example, this might work great when you have only one or two parameters to estimate. Once you have more than that, however, this becomes very unwieldy and computationally expensive, because you have to generate a grid over as many dimensions as you have parameters. Secondly, what should the resolution of your grid be? What if you have a likelihood that's zero almost everywhere except for a small region of parameter space? If you make your grid too coarse, you run the risk of never actually getting close to the maximum likelihood at all. If you make it fine-grained, you are wasting a lot of computational time on regions of parameter space that are entirely uninteresting. \n",
    "\n",
    "One common way is to use **optimization**. Optimization algorithms usually start at a single point in parameter space, and then try to find intelligent ways to pick the next step where to estimate the likelihood. Often, this involves calculating the *gradient* of the likelihood to inform the algorithm where to step next. There's a wide range of different algorithms out there, suited to a number of different problems, but one good place to start is the `scipy.optimize` sub-module. \n",
    "\n",
    "One subtlety about optimization is that while we are trying to find the parameters where the likelihood has its *maximum*, most optimization algorithms are in practice *minimization* routines. That is, they attempt to find the minimum of a function. \n",

However, for some parameters, this turns out not to be a good, uninformative choice. This is especially true for parameters that can range over multiple orders of magnitude.

    "MCMC describes a set of algorithms that define rules to intelligently step in parameter space, with the goal to explore the probability distribution. In the basic concept, starting from some point in parameter space, the algorithm will pick a new point according to some proposal distribution $q(\\theta)$. It then compares the posterior probability of the new point with the posterior probability of the old point. If the ratio of the two $r$ is larger than one, the new point is kept. If it's smaller than 1, then the new point will be accepted with probability $r$ and rejected with probability $1-r$. If it's not accepted, the original point will be duplicated, and the procedure starts again. If the new point is accepted, it will become the next point to jump from according to the proposal distribution $q$. In this way, we build up a list of points--or more commonly referred to as *samples*--that is denser in regions of high probability and less dense in regions of low probability. If you run this algorithm for long enough (ideally, to infinity, but who has time for that?), the samples will provide a good approximation to the posterior density. \n",

There are better algorithms for most problems (though don't underestimate how powerful Metropolis-Hastings can be on the right problem!), but writing your own sampler is invaluable for understanding some of the tricky problems with samplings.

    "We're not done just having found a maximum likelihood value or a posterior sample. We now have to answer the most important question: **Does our result make sense**? \n",
    "\n",
    "This is, of course, a complicated question to answer, and it's very dependent on the problem you're solving. \n",
    "But here are some starting questions you can ask yourselves:\n",
    "* Is the likelihood function I've chosen actually appropriate for the data you have? Or did my data come from a different distribution? Was your collaborator right? Should you use a Gaussian likelihood here? Or do you think you should use a Poisson distribution? Why or why not?\n",
    "* If I take my best-fit model, or draw samples from the posterior, are the functions it generates good representations of the data I've observed? Hint: This is hard to do in 2D, so I'd recomment plotting the data and model for slices through the image.\n",
    "* Is my MCMC procedure converged to the posterior?\n",
    "* Do my priors make sense? Especially hard boundaries on flat priors are a very strong assumption (you're saying there's no way the parameter value could ever lie outside of those boundaries), so checking whether these make sense can be a useful way to troubleshoot.\n",
    "* Where are there bugs in my code? Because there are always bugs in code. :) \n",
    "* What does my posterior look like compared to my prior? Are they close to each other? Are they far away from each other? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Useful Information**: If you've done model fitting in the past, you might have heard that the summed squared residuals, or $\\chi^2$ divided by the degrees of freedom, should be close to 1 for the model to be a good representation. This works because for data with Gaussian uncertainties (where you use a Gaussian likelihood in your modeling), the sum of the log-likelihood for all data points is distributed following a $\\chi^2$ distribution scaled by the degrees of freedom, which in turn means that if you divide by the degrees of freedom, you get a central chi-square distribution with a mean of $1$. The further away you are from that mean, the smaller the probability that your residuals were independent draws from a Gaussian distribution, which they should be if the model were exactly the true, underlying process that generated your observed data. This is a useful diagnostic for checking your model, but it only works well if your likelihood is Gaussian.\n",

    "**Exercise 1**:\n",

    "Do you think that your posterior inference gets close to the true parameters? Why or why not? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 2**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare your results with some of the other groups. Are they similar? Are they very different? If they are different, can you figure out why? "
