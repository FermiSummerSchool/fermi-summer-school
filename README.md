To run the `fermipy` notebooks: Please first download and extract the precomputed data files:

```
wget https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/mtgs/summerschool/2021/fermipyTutorialData.tgz
tar xf fermipyTutorialData.tgz
mv data ./Likelihood_Advanced
``` 

The main `fermipy` notebook is _Likelihood_Advanced/Likelihood With fermiPy.ipynb_. Run this first as the other notebooks in the same directory rely on the output of the first notebook.
